Also a trend of moving the living room to coffee shops can be noticed, in Stockholm Sweden, at least. As apartments/houses get smaller it is easier for people to meet in coffee shops instead.\n\nThe project will investigate the cost of housing/apartments and compare it to the number of coffee shops and pizza places in the surrounding area of major cities.\n\nThe goal is to be able to predict not only the cost of housing and apartments based on the availability of coffee shops and pizza places, but also correlate to the age of the people that live in the area defined by the number of coffee shops and pizza places. As we also want to be able to predict something about the age of people living in the neighborhood the project is about the social economic aspect of a neighborhood.",

For European costs a fixed exchange rate will be used. The exchange rate will be determined in relation to the available cost data and which time/date range is being covered. The data should not be older than 3 years. \n\nIf no relevant current housing cost statistics data are available, cost based on real estate agency pricing can be used.\nAs we are really interested in the social economic aspects of locations, the income distribution of a city area can also be used instead of housing cost.\n\nIn this project the data for the following cities will be used New York, Toronto, Stockholm as a first trail. The data will be used to investigate and analyze the project goals using a borough level resolution.\n\nAs foursquare data does not really have an age pedigree, it must be determined to be correct as of today, thus the cost and demographic data should be as close to today as possible.",
